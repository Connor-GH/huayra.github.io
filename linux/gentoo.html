    <br>What is Gentoo?
    <br>
    <br>Well, it is the choice distribution for many linux
    <br>enthusiasts. Meaning, that the user gets the most
    <br>control of their operating system, at the small
    <br>cost of adjusting some settings themselves, along
    <br>with compiling every source-based package on their own.
    <br>In other distributions (formerly distros), the source
    <br>code is given to an official server, or "mirror". These
    <br>servers then have the job of compiling the code into 
    <br>something that your computer can understand. This 
    <br>process tends to be resource-intensive and can take
    <br>a worrying amount of time. Luckily, for what are
    <br>called "binary distros", this process is taken care
    <br>of for you. The Gentoo Linux distribution gives the
    <br>power of one of these servers, and more, in the user's
    <br>hands. If having control of your computer interests you,
    <br>then you should look into Gentoo Linux.
