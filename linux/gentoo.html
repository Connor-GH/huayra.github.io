    <p>What is Gentoo?
  		<br>
  		<br>Well, it is the choice distribution for many linux
  		<br>enthusiasts. Meaning, that the user gets the most
  		<br>control of their operating system, at the small
  		<br>cost of adjusting some settings themselves, along
  		<br>with compiling every source-based package on their own.
  		<br>In other distributions (formerly distros), the source
  		<br>code is given to an official server, or "mirror". These
  		<br>servers then have the job of compiling the code into
  		<br>something that your computer can understand. This
  		<br>process tends to be resource-intensive and can take
  		<br>a worrying amount of time. Luckily, for what are
  		<br>called "binary distros", this process is taken care
  		<br>of for you. The Gentoo Linux distribution gives the
  		<br>power of one of these servers, and more, to the user.
  		<br>If having control of your computer interests you,
  		<br>then you should look into <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> Linux.
