      <h1>Huayra's Website - How to Delete Twitter?</h1>
    </header>
    <br><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account">This article</a> explains exactly how to delete a twitter account.
    <br>(sorry for the twitter link, I know they have a lot of trackers. uBlock Origin says 21 trackers and 12 javascript scripts attempted to be executed. However, I needed a tutorial that I knew wouldn't get deleted from the internet)
    <br>
    <br><b>Question: Why would you want to delete twitter?</b>
    <br>
    <br>Answer: politics are distracting. Stop focusing on other people's problems and focus on your own problems.
    <br>
    <br>You might have also wondered, why does the "deactivation" process take <b>30 days</b>? It is to tempt the user to
    <br>go back to the platform. After a few weeks, they may send you a message saying that your account is about to be deleted
    <br>as well, and this is also another way to get you back on the platform. 
    <br>
    <br><b>Question: Why do they do this?</b>
    <br>
    <br>Answer: The answer is quite simple. The longer you are on the platform, the more ads and media you are served, which 
    <br>is designed to keep you on the platform. As long as you are on the platform, they can legally harvest and sell your data.
    <br>News excites and angers people. These are primitive emotions, and therefore, our brains might not stop to realise that
    <br>the content that we consume on a daily basis is hurting us.
    <br>
    <br><b>Question: When did you delete your twitter account?</b>
    <br>
    <br>Answer: I never had one. I did make the mistake of having other social medias at one time, but I no longer have them. 
    <br>I talk through IRC.
