        What is an Exokernel?

    Background:

    In order to understand what an Exokernel is, it is important to understand
    what a kernel is. A kernel simply manages resources for applications. It is
    an important job of the kernel to make sure userspace applications do not
    interfere with each other in a potentially harmful manner, such as the
    poisoning of a CPU's registers (see: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/2/22/33">AMD Ryzen Zen 2's XSAVE vulnerabilities</a>).
    An operational kernel must know more knowledge about the hardware than other
    applications so that it probably has more control over the hardware than an
    ordinary user; after all, it is probably a bad idea if an inexperienced user
    has the ability to manipulate their hardware outside of the kernel's control.
    A kernel may also supply generic and primitive drivers for devices like serial
    and PS/2 input devices.

    There are examples of kernels that move all of the drivers into a userland -
    that is, away from the kernel - and into pseudo-containers, where the kernel
    watches the drivers' actions closely and "relaunches" a driver if it fails as
    if it were a normal program. This type of driver-isolated kernel is called a
    microkernel, and it is the basis for many operating systems, such as Andrew
    Tanenbaum et al.'s Minix, Carnegie Mellon University's Mach, the GNU Foundation's
    Hurd, etc. To an extent, both MacOS XNU and Windows NT use a microkernel in the
    sense that there is a hybrid of drivers in userspace and drivers in the kernel.


    Exokernel:

    The Exokernel was an idea originally developed by the MIT Parallel and Distributed
    Operating Systems group (P&amp;D OS) with the goal of improving performance
    and scaling on systems that needed it, such as web servers and file servers.
    An Exokernel's goal is to remove the abstraction caused by having drivers in the
    kernel. When writing drivers, the main goal is normally to expose hardware
    resources in a more humanly-readable format. No programmer wants to remember the
    memory address for a specific segment in memory; rather, they will use some
    identifier - something like SEGMENT_ADDRESS - and typically forget about where
    that segment actually is in memory. This is an example of an abstraction that has
    no cost because the compiler will just replace every occurrance of SEGMENT_ADDRESS
    with the real address that the identifier is representing. Most driver abstractions,
    however, have cost.

    A VGA driver in a kernel might expose a lone clear_screen()
    for clearing all of the screen; this might have fulfilled the purpose that the
    original developers sought for the kernel, but an application developer might
    be disappointed in the lack of driver call for clearing a single pixel. In
    an exokernel environment, an application developer would choose a libraryOS -
    a library of abstractions and bindings to the kernel - that best suits their
    needs. Just because a function suits the needs of most developers does not
    mean that it suits the needs for all developers; therefore, it is valuable
    for an application developer to have the ability to choose their own
    abstractions and pay for their runtime proportionally.

    Consider the following example as well: a kernel developer writes a memory
    mapping table and maps all physical pages of memory to a virtual page of
    memory, plus an arbitrary offset. For an embedded developer that works on
    WiFi routers, it would be important to have memory directly mapped "1:1",
    so that the first virtual page corresponds to the first physical page;
    after all, these devices might have 32MB of RAM, and so every byte matters
    in order to fit as many features on the devices as possible. Rather than
    writing a new operating system and kernel for that WiFi router, the
    development team could develop or use a libraryOS that fits their model
    of abstractions needed for their project, saving them development time
    and effort.

    There is also the very specific but developer-familiar problem of
    compilation time. Compiling code takes a relatively long time, which
    leaves the application developer to contemplate whether there are faster
    compilation methods. Compiling without optimizations saves a significant
    amount of time, but ultimately leaves the developer with a sub-optimally
    performing program. The exokernel offers the potential solution of
    cutting most abstractions altogether, and just writing code directly to
    disk, directly accessing memory blocks, and having a very predictable cpu
    wait time due to the time-allocation method that exokernels like Aegis
    and XOK use. In doing so, the application develoer will spend significantly
    less time compiling code, making their workflow more productive.

    An exokernel addresses the potential issue of direct hardware access by
    leaving secure bindings in the kernel for hardware resources. An exokernel
    may have a fairly primitive CPU scheduler - a time-sharing scheduler -
    that splits up CPU time between applications based on priority level. In
    limiting CPU time for an application, no single application can take over
    the system by a kernel fault; if an application is using too much CPU time,
    the kernel will simply halt its work, save the registers for that application,
    and swap to another process. In the case of memory, an exokernel would
    allocate certain pages to programs and occasionally ask for the memory to
    be taken back if it is not being used. If an application is requesting
    memory too frequently or not giving back its unallocated pages, the kernel
    will simply take its resources back, preserving the security of the kernel.
    In general, no operation related to hardware would skip passing through the
    kernel; the operation would just pass through less of the kernel due to
    the reduced amount of code needed inside of it.

    Overall, an exokernel minimizes the need for kernel-level abstractions, and
    instead offloads this to the userland and kernel bindings, where it can be
    application-specific, this speeding up the execution time of programs
    significantly. Security is handled through basic hardware management and
    revocation, which proves to be a reliable system for preventing kernel
    lock-ups and panics.
