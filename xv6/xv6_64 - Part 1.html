		Humble Beginnings<br>

		My previous project, <a href="https://github.com/connor-gh/relics">relics</a>,
		was a massive failure. That self-proclaimed "exokernel" couldn't even get
		into userland! On a good day, it would kernel panic if built with O2 (it failed to
		build without optimizations -- a sign of bad software). On a bad day, you would
		chase down a bug for <b>eleven months</b>. Yeah. I spent 11 months trying to
		figure out why interrupts wouldn't work. The bug was, of course, a single
		line of code. This project wasn't even in the stages where it could be able
		to be used with a debugger, so any debugging had to happen with printf.
		What's worse is that CPUs execute very fast and sometimes out-of-order.
		This sometimes results in a triple fault and reset in qemu before the code
		before it could execute debug printfs. Code like <code>printf("Foo"); triple_fault();</code>
		might not even print "Foo" at all! Talk about a debugging nightmare.<br>

		One night, out of frustration, I gave up. I decided that I like osdev,
		but I don't like the OS I made from scratch. It didn't do nearly what I
		wanted and couldn't ever be made to do so. So I took to the internet in
		search of easy-to-learn educational operating systems, and someone
		suggested xv6: a small operating system made by the MIT PDOS group that
		tried to be a small UNIX-like system, while still being teachable.
		Armed with this knowledge, I looked through the code and determined it
		to be good if I could make it work.<br>

		Oh man, I did not know what I would get myself into with this project.
		At the time of forking, xv6 had been effectively dead for 8-18 years,
		depending on who you ask. The final nail was put in the coffin when they
		put a message in the README saying that the project was no longer maintained.
		When trying to build this outdated project, gcc will throw a million errors
		at you, talking about one for infinite recursion in sh.c, another for some
		old-style C, and so forth. Once you finally get the thing to build, it
		doesn't run! Luckily,
		<a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/pull/155">some savior in the PRs</a>
		commented a fix, and I was back to business. After I got it to build, I
		called it good and pushed my fork to my own branch, <code>relics</code>, named
		after my previous operating system attempt. I ran <code>clang-format</code> on
		the source with the style of the linux kernel -- my favorite style.
		After that, I separated the .c files for the kernel space and userspace
		into directories and added some Makefiles in those directories to better
		separate them. This would later prove integral as userspace quickly
		diverged, needing many different CFLAGS from the kernel. If you look
		in kernel/boot/, you will find initcode64.S. This is a 64-bit port of
		initcode.S found in the original build of xv6. Its relevance is that
		it is technically userspace code and has no business being in the
		kernel directory (much less kernel/boot), but I have gotten used to
		it there, so I don't care to move it. It's not like userspace doesn't
		use assembly because it does: usys.S.<br>

		Anyway, I should wrap this up. This blog is only supposed to go over
		the initial history of xv6_64, specifically <b>the first day</b>.
		All of this work was done in one day! I will do this for every blogpost,
		but the relevant commits are at the bottom of this post for proof.<br>
